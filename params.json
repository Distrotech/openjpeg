These libraries will be built only if there are not found on the system. Note that libopenjpeg itself does not have any dependency.\r\n* doc: doxygen documentation setup file and man pages\r\n* tests: configuration files and utilities for the openjpeg test suite. All test images are located in 'http://openjpeg.googlecode.com/svn/data' folder.\r\n* cmake: cmake related files\r\n\r\nsee LICENSE for license and copyright information.\r\nsee INSTALL for installation procedures.\r\nsee NEWS for user visible changes in successive releases.\r\nsee CHANGES for per-revision changes.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\nAPI/ABI\r\n\r\nOpenJPEG strives to provide a stable API/ABI for your applications. As such it\r\nonly exposes a limited subset of its functions.  It uses a mecanism of\r\nexporting/hiding functions. If you are unsure which functions you can use in\r\nyour applications, you should compile OpenJPEG using something similar to gcc:\r\n-fvisibility=hidden compilation flag.\r\nSee also: http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility\r\n\r\nOn windows, MSVC directly supports export/hidding function and as such the only\r\nAPI available is the one supported by OpenJPEG.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
