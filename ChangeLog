* : fixed

January 30, 2007
! [FOD] Use of OPJ_PATH_LEN (defined as 4096) to be the maximum allowed size for filenames instead of MAX_PATH which is not always defined. This caused some programs using OpenJPEG to crash. Modifications in openjpeg.h j2k_to_image.c and image_to_j2k.c
! [FOD] Correction of the syntax usage in MJ2_codec/mj2_to_frames.c

January 23, 2007
! [FOD] Modification in the context numbers, to reflect what has been specified in standard, in libopenjpeg/t1.h

December 07, 2006
+ [Giuseppe Baruffa] Antonin verified that the MacOS build suffered from a missing definition of the "min" macro; I've added this definition (properly #ifndef'ed) into both jpwl.h and rs.h

December 05, 2006
* [Giuseppe Baruffa] Better fix of the TPH EPBs bug in JPWL module
* [GB] Fixed the UEP bug in JPWL module; now, during a UEP specification, RS protection or CRC check can be switched off for selected range of packets, and consequently reswitched on without confusing the decoder
+ [GB] Added some lines in the help of JPWL_image_to_j2k, specifying that when using error protection on data packets, this must be paired with header protection, i.e. there cannot be packet protection without header protection

December 04, 2006

+ [Francois-Olivier Devaux] New tag: version1.0 (includes codec and libopenjpeg directories)
Total update of JPWL module
    - [FOD] removed directories jpwl/decoder, jpwl/encoder, jpwl/decoder_02, jpwl/encoder_02
    + [FOD] added in JPWL directory crc.h, jpwl.h, rs.h, crc.c, jpwl.c, jpwl_lib.c, rs.c, JPWL_image_to_j2k.dsp, JPWL_j2k_to_image.dsp, LibOpenJPEG_JPWL.dsp, JPWL_image_to_j2k.dsw, JPWL_j2k_to_image.dsw
    ! [FOD] Modifications of libopenjpeg to integrate JPWL module (in libopenjpeg directory): j2k.c, j2k.h, openjpeg.c, openjpeg.h, opj_includes.g, t2.c
    ! [FOD] Modification of codec to integrate JPWL module (in codec directory): image_to_j2k.c, j2k_to_image.c
* [FOD] Corrected incorrect fprintf() formatting in codec/convert.c
* [FOD] Code optimization usinq vsprintf() command in libopenjpeg/event.c
