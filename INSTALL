How to build and install openjpeg3d binaries
==========================================

REQUIREMENT : cmake (see www.cmake.org)

Type:
  cmake .
  make

If you are root:
  make install
  make clean

else:
  sudo make install
  make clean

Binaries are located in the 'bin' directory.

Main available cmake flags:
* To specify the install path: '-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path'
* To build the shared libraries and links the executables against it: '-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:bool=on' (default: 'ON')
  Note: when using this option, static libraries are not built and executables are dynamically linked.
