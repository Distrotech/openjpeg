How to build and install openjpeg binaries
==========================================

UNIX/LINUX similar systems
--------------------------

1) Using configure tools

You can simply type
  ./configure [--prefix=/path]
  make

If you are root:
  make install
  make clean
  make distclean

else:
  sudo make install
  make clean
  make distclean

Binaries are located in the 'bin' directory.

If 'configure' does not work on your system please
call './bootstrap.sh'.

If 'configure' does not find a library or header file,
or to see available configure options, please try 
'./configure --help'.

2) Using cmake (see www.cmake.org)

Type:
  cmake .
  make

If you are root:
  make install
  make clean

else:
  sudo make install
  make clean

Binaries are located in the 'bin' directory.

Main available cmake flags:
* To specify the install path: '-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path'
* To build the shared libraries: '-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS:bool=on'
* To build the example codec: '-DBUILD_EXAMPLES:bool=on' (default is actually 'ON')
* To build the JPWL binaries: '-DBUILD_JPWL:bool=on'
* To build the JP3D binaries: '-DBUILD_JP3D:bool=on'
* To build the doxygen documentation: '-DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION:bool=on'
* To enable testing (and automatic result upload to http://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=OPENJPEG):
    cmake . -DBUILD_TESTING:BOOL=ON -DJPEG2000_CONFORMANCE_DATA_ROOT:PATH=/path/to/your/JPEG2000/test/files
    make
    make Experimental
  Note : JPEG2000 test files are available here : http://www.crc.ricoh.com/~gormish/jpeg2000conformance/

3) Manually using Makefile.nix:
- Manually edit the config.nix file
- Manually create an opj_config.h file from opj_config.h.in.user
- Then : (remove the unwanted targets)
    make -f Makefile.nix all jpwl-all jp3d-all doc-all
    make -f Makefile.nix clean jpwl-clean jp3d-clean doc-clean
    make -f Makefile.nix install jpwl-install jp3d-install
    make -f Makefile.nix uninstall jpwl-uninstall jp3d-uninstall


MACOSX
------

The same building procedures as above will soon be available for MACOSX.
The xcode project file has also to be updated.
Right now, the CMake procedure is the only one working. Please refer to instructions above.
If it does not work, try adding the following flag to the cmake command : 
  '-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES:STRING=i386'

WINDOWS
-------

If you're using cygwin, the same procedures as for Unix should work. Otherwise:

1) Using cmake to generate project files

Use the cmake procedure above with the '-G <generator-name>' flag to generate the project
files for the IDE you are using. Type 'cmake --help' for available generators on your platform.

2) Using the provided project files

These files are obsolete and will be updated soon.
